				<p>Since childhood, I’ve always been curious about how things are made. I started creating on my own at a young age. Influenced by my mom, who was a skilled tailor, I made my first simple set of clothes when I was 11. In high school, I sold my first handmade birthday cards to classmates — and I was proud to have returning “customers” who occasionally ordered custom cards or beaded jewelry from me.				
				<p>My love for handmade crafts grew over time and has become a significant part of who I am. I’ve worked with various materials, but fabric and paper are my favorites. Even when I don’t have time to craft, I still enjoy window-shopping in fabric and paper stores.
				<p>These days, I mostly create unique pieces as gifts for friends and family, but lately I’ve become obsessed with paper flowers. I decided to open a small Etsy shop as an outlet for my experimental work — mostly because it started to take over my space!
				<p>Here on my site, you’ll find many of the things I’ve made over the past few years. If you’d like a custom piece or want to collaborate on something creative, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s connect and make something beautiful together 💛
				<p>I’m so happy to have you here!
				</p>
				
				<p>Love,
					<br>Ly
