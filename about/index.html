				<p>Since childhood, I've always been fascinated by how things are made, which led me to become obsessed with learning how to make them myself. My love for handmade crafts and the process of creating things has become a significant part of who I am.
				<p>I started by creating small items, like cards and jewelry, and gradually moved on to more complex projects such as paper flowers and dresses. Sometimes I make unique pieces for friends and family, and I also sell my handmade items. The process of creating things from scratch excites me, and I'm extremely proud of what I do.
				<p>Take a look around my site to see the products I create. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like a custom piece made just for you.
				</p>
				
				<p>Love,
					<br>Ly
