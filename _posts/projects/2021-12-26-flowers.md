<p>
  “The Roses” is a beautiful bouquet which is arranged for the one who especially loves yellow roses.<br>
  The combination between white and yellow with different shades of green makes the bouquet appear tasteful, elegant, and natural. Take a closer look at the leaves and you can see the veins that are carefully crafted from crêpe paper which makes a perfect real-life detail. With this bouquet, the joy of observing it lasts longer as it won’t be withered.
